  <p class="description_paragraph">Snorkeling is a wonderful activity that can be enjoyed by almost anyone who has access to the ocean, a lake, river, pond or quarry. Snorkeling as an activity frequently lives in the shadows of scuba diving - another excellent pastime, but one that requires significantly more instruction, time and money. Most people who have snorkeled have done so only on group charters while on vacation, but snorkeling is an activity that can be done almost anytime, anywhere.

   <p class="description_paragraph"> 
       The differences between scuba diving and snorkeling are huge. The differences lay both in equipment and range. Both sports allow you to breathe underwater, however, with snorkeling you are limited to the top of the water or the short distance you can swim holding your breath under the water. This makes swimming far below sea level impossible. Your equipment is basic, just a one size fits all mask, snorkel, and set of fins and you won’t need any training. Diving is another animal altogether. Not only do you need to have a wide assortment of equipment, but you need to take a certification course to be able to go out on the boat whenever you want. That said many of the world’s best and easiest to reach underwater spots can also be snorkeled and many advanced divers even opt to snorkel if given the option.
